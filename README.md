This was a project for dtu course "Embedded Systems Design"

This repository is the used `./main` folder using ESP-IDF to program an ESP32 microcontroller. 

In this project we create a plant monitoring system, with a microcontroller (ESP32-C3), to simulate the use of embedded systems.

Components used:
* button (PTS645)
* OLED-display (MDOB128064WV-YBI)
* photocell (Adafruit Industries)
* piezo buzzer (PS1240)
* RGB-led (WP154A4SUREQBFZGW)
* soil sensor (Adafruit Industries)
* temperature & humidity sensor (AM2320)
